								<h2>Scientific Goals</h2>
								<p>The main focus of the newly proposed Marsden project titled "Our Stormy Past: Resolving the role that tropical and high latitude climate modes have played in driving New ZealandÂ¿s climate over the past 15,000 years" is to explore a 15,000 year record of storm intensity and precipitation over New Zealand at annual resolution. A feasibility study was recently conducted to investigate the quality of climate record captured in the sediment cores extracted from Lake Ohau located in the South Island. More detailed analysis will contribute to the reconstruction of the past inter-annual climate variability of run-off and precipitation in South Island catchments.</p>

								<p>The Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulations are on one hand, paramount in linking climate data derived from local proxies, here sediments, to wider regional (e.g. Kidson-type) patterns and large scale climate modes such as El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). On the other hand, the high resolution regional climate model data can be validated and checked for consistency using the new independent high frequency climate record. Global and regional model transient simulations for warm, cool and transitional periods on multi-decadal time slices selected from the past 1000 years will be performed. Assessment of climate simulations will subsequently be conducted by comparing the model climatologies with those derived from Lake Ohau sediment records and related to the large scale climate modes.</p>
