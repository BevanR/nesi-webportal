Setting up BeHat Tests
======================

Getting started
---------------

* To start running the tests the only out side dependancy is **Composer**. Check [composer installation instructions](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
* Download additional dependancies by running: **composer install** from root of the **tests** dir.
* Run tests : **bin/behat** from root of the **tests** dir.
* That's it!
